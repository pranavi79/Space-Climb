# <a name="description"></a>Description
* Space-Climb is a desktop multiplayer climbing game where players compete to reach the endpoint.  The Sooner someone reaches, the hustle for the winner tag ends.
* The map contains wooden blocks as an aid to move up. Each player has a gun, aka the grappling hook.
* One can grapple the box on mouse-click and swing. But, WAIT, you can grapple only the wooden box and that too at a certain height from you. The material for the graspable one's changes..

# <a name="future"></a>Future Aspects
* Add object pooling for random spawning of wooden blocks, thereby increasing the difficulty.
* Add multiple maps to elevate the fever for Space-Climb.
* Customize lobby.
* Avail the powerups for the players and along with allowing them to cut the rope of opponents.
